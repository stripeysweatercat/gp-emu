# <center>GamePerigon Emulator!</center>
## Info
A silly little gameboy emulator I am attempting to create in C++. It probably wont be terribly accurate to original hardware, and 
is unlikely to have a ton of debug features either. Also cannot guarantee that it will ever get completed, but with my current
interest in console emulation it should get mostly completed :3.

## Hopeful Features
* Run Gameboy games (woahhh)
* Run on different OS with SDL
* Savestates, frame advance, slow-down / speed-up, other cool emulator features
* Decompile game cartridge into readable assembly (impprobable but i can be optimistic)
